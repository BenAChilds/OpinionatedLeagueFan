Opinionated League Fan is a simple Reddit bot written in Python that utilises the OpenAI API to respond to comments and posts on Reddit.
As the name suggests, it was originally designed to operate in the r/NRL rugby league subreddit, however this came to an end in the very early 
stages of its operation and it has since moved on to other subs.
